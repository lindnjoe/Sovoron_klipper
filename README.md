## Virtual input pins

This repository includes a small Klipper module that lets you define
software input pins.  Each pin is addressed through the chip name
`virtual_pin` so it can be referenced like `virtual_pin:runout_button` in
other configuration sections.

Legacy configurations using `[ams_pin]` sections still work via a
compatibility wrapper that forwards to the same implementation.

Add a section such as:

```
[virtual_input_pin runout_button]
initial_value: 1
```

Change the pin state with `SET_VIRTUAL_PIN PIN=runout_button VALUE=0`
and query it with `QUERY_VIRTUAL_PIN PIN=runout_button`.
